# AquaCulture Mate

Welcome to AquaCulture Mate official GitHub Page!

## Executive Summary/Abstract:
Our project aims to revolutionize fish farming in Indonesia by leveraging technology to address key challenges faced by fish farmers. With Indonesia's significant production of freshwater fish, including popular species like tilapia, catfish, and carp, and its substantial contribution to the national economy, there is a pressing need for innovative solutions to enhance productivity and sustainability in the aquaculture industry. Despite the vast potential, fish farmers often encounter difficulties in optimizing their operations, managing resources efficiently, and accessing relevant information.

Therefore, our team proposes the development of a mobile application integrated with Google Cloud and machine learning capabilities to provide fish farmers with tools for efficient farm management, species identification, and knowledge sharing. By empowering fish farmers with accessible and advanced technology solutions, we aim to improve their livelihoods, contribute to food security, and promote sustainable practices in the aquaculture sector.
